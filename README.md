Java-specific language server &amp; Tree-sitter powered tools.

### Requires
- Neovim >= 0.5
- [nvim-treesitter/](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)

### Recommended
- [nvim-jdtls](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls)

### Usage
TODO

### Goal
Use Neovim's builtin LSP support and Tree-sitter to improve my Java workflow and eliminate my reliance on IDEs for tasks like refactoring.

### Non-goals
This plugin should not implement full-fledged refactoring capabilities, as those should eventually be implemented by the language server itself.

### Features

### Todo
