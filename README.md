[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATE:-DRAFT-yellow.svg)](https://shields.io/)

Java-specific language server &amp; Tree-sitter powered tools.

### Requirements
- Neovim >= 0.5
- [nvim-treesitter/](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)
- A Java language server, such as [jdt.ls](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls)

### Recommended
- [nvim-jdtls](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls)

### Usage
TODO

### Goal
Use Neovim's builtin LSP support and Tree-sitter to improve my Java workflow and eliminate my reliance on IDEs for tasks like refactoring.

### Non-goals
This plugin should not implement full-fledged refactoring capabilities, as those should eventually be implemented by the language server itself.

### Features

### Todo

- [x] Yank public method definitions from class
- [x] Yank interface definition from class
- [ ] Yank implementation definition from interface
